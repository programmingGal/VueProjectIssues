Vue.js project - creating a responsive web design

I created this repository so I can get help with issues I may encounter while working on a project in Vue.js.
I am using Vue.js, with axios to connect to the backend - backend is mySql database that I connect to with php code. 

I would like to use Vue.js to update my company's software application to reflect the needs of our customers, who would like to be able to use the software with various sized devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
